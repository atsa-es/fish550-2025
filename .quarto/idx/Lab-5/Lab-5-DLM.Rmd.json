Much work has been done on this topic, particularly by Randall Peterman and his students and post-docs at Simon Fraser University. To do so, researchers commonly use a Ricker model because of its relatively simple form, such that the number of recruits (offspring) born in year $t$ ($R_t$) from the number of spawners (parents) ($S_t$) is\n\n\\begin{equation}\nR_t = a S_t e^{-b S + v_t}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nThe parameter $a$ determines the maximum reproductive rate in the absence of any density-dependent effects (the slope of the curve at the origin), $b$ is the strength of density dependence, and $v_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma)$. In practice, the model is typically log-transformed so as to make it linear with respect to the predictor variable $S_t$, such that\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{log}(R_t) &= \\text{log}(a) + \\text{log}(S_t) -b S_t + v_t \\\\\n\\text{log}(R_t) - \\text{log}(S_t) &= \\text{log}(a) -b S_t + v_t \\\\\n\\text{log}(R_t/S_t) &= \\text{log}(a) - b S_t + v_t.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nSubstituting $y_t = \\text{log}(R_t/S_t)$, $x_t = S_t$, and $\\alpha = \\text{log}(a)$ yields a simple linear regression model with intercept $\\alpha$ and slope $b$.\n\nUnfortunately, however, residuals from this simple model typically show high-autocorrelation due to common environmental conditions that affect overlapping generations. Therefore, to correct for this and allow for an index of stock productivity that controls for any density-dependent effects, the model may be re-written as\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{log}(R_t/S_t) &= \\alpha_t - b S_t + v_t, \\\\\n\\alpha_t &= \\alpha_{t-1} + w_t,\n\\end{align}\n\nand $w_t \\sim N(0,q)$. By treating the brood-year specific productivity as a random walk, we allow it to vary, but in an autocorrelated manner so that consecutive years are not independent from one another.\n\nMore recently, interest has grown in using covariates ($e.g.$, sea-surface temperature) to explain the interannual variability in productivity. In that case, we can can write the model as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{log}(R_t/S_t) = \\alpha + \\delta_t X_t - b S_t + v_t.\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn this case we are estimating some base-level productivity ($\\alpha$) plus the time-varying effect of some covariate $X_t$ ($\\delta_t$). \n\n\n\n### Spawner-recruit data {#sec-dlm-spawner-recruit-data}\n\nThe data come from a large public database begun by Ransom Myers many years ago.
